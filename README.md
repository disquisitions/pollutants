**Part I**

Presently, this project retrieves the nitrogen dioxide readings of telemetric devices at particular locations within 
Scotland.  Usage notes upcoming.

* [The stations metadata of the telemetric devices](https://www.scottishairquality.scot/sos-scotland/api/v1/stations)
* [The pollutants that Scottish Air Quality focus on](https://www.scottishairquality.scot/sos-scotland/api/v1/phenomena)
  * [The pollutants dictionary](https://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabulary/aq/pollutant/view)
* [The metadata of the timeseries](https://www.scottishairquality.scot/sos-scotland/api/v1/timeseries): The metadata 
  includes a field of unique sequence identification codes.  Each identification code is associated with the 
  continuous pollutant level recordings of a particular pollutant at a particular telemetric devices station.
